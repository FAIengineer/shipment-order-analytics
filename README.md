# 📦 Shipment Orders Data Pipeline & Analytics (Python + PostgreSQL)

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data workflow combining **Python**, **PostgreSQL**, **SQLAlchemy**, **psycopg2**, and **pandas** to practice real-world **data engineering** and **data analytics** skills.

The dataset used is the **Shipment Orders Dataset** from Kaggle.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project simulates a realistic data process involving:

- Programmatic dataset download using the **Kaggle API**
- Extracting and preparing data with Python (`zipfile`, pandas)
- Loading cleaned data into **PostgreSQL** using SQLAlchemy + psycopg2
- Performing analytical and exploratory exercises in both **pandas** and **SQL**
- Using **pgAdmin4** to inspect tables and execute SQL queries

Although the project follows a YouTube tutorial for guidance, all work was independently reproduced and expanded for learning and practice.
